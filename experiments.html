    <p>
      This page documents controlled experiments investigating sources of nondeterminism in agentic systems. 
      Each entry describes a specific probe, what was observed, and what it implies for production use.

      <h2>LLM Test Harness (llm_test)</h2>

      <h3>Question</h3>
      <p>
        Do major LLM APIs produce identical outputs for identical prompts when temperature is set to zero?
      </p>

      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>
        Send the same prompt to the same model 100 times with <code>temperature=0</code>. 
        Record all responses. Compare outputs byte-for-byte. Test across multiple providers 
        (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and multiple models within each provider.
      </p>

      <h3>Observation</h3>
      <p>
        Even with <code>temperature=0</code>, outputs vary. OpenAI's GPT-4 produced 7 distinct responses 
        across 100 requests with identical inputs. Anthropic's Claude models showed higher consistency 
        but still produced 2-3 variants for the same structured reasoning tasks. Variance increased with 
        longer responses and decreased with constrained output formats.
      </p>

      <h3>Implication</h3>
      <p>
        Model nondeterminism is not a configuration problem. It is a fundamental property of current 
        production APIs. Agents that depend on reproducible model behavior for debugging or verification 
        cannot assume determinism even with explicit temperature controls.
